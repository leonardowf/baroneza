## üî® Getting started
You will need `npm` and then you can do `npm run start:watch`.
To run tests you can use `jest`.
You will also need a `.env` file with the following environment variables:
```
JIRA_AUTH_TOKEN=
JIRA_USER_NAME=
GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN=

```
On slack, the app must be able to read reactions and write messages.

## üöÄ Deploying
SOON

## üìñ Documentation
You can check the supported endpoints in the swagger page: `localhost:3000/swagger`

## üèó Architecture
The idea is to keep it simple with no hard abstractions, but also maintaining flexibility to increase LOC covered.
The main components are: Endpoints, UseCases, Workers and Services.

### Endpoints
Endpoints are the entry of every request. They exist to keep documented all the supported APIs. They should map 1:1 to a UseCase.

### UseCases
UseCases perform the logic of the application. They can have other UseCases as dependencies and also many Workers.

### Workers
Workers do only one thing. They can have Services as dependencies.

### Services
Services make the bridge of baroneza and external APIs.

### Should I create a Worker or a UseCase?
There is no silver bullet and don't waste too much brainpower on this. The rule of thumb used is:
- If the problem that you are trying to solve requires an AND, then go with a UseCase.
- If you can think of your problem as one single atomic responsibility, go with a Worker.
Example: To create a release, we need to create a branch and create the pr and parse the commits and ... The amount of different things that need to be done fit an use case. Now, parsing and creating a branch, sound like an atomic operation that don't care about previous steps, they fit as a worker.
